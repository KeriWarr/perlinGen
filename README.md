perlinGen
=========

This repo is a command line proof-of-concept program in which Perlin Noise is used to generate random, terrain with realistic characteristics.

I am planning on using the code in this repo for future projects in which a large or endless procedurally genereated environment is needed

Usage
-----

* run `make`
* execute `./main`
* An ASCII map with be printed to STDOUT

* Can be configured to print to a prettified HTML file.
